# AA_2022-23_Team_8
This is Team 8's team repo for the 2022/23 class of Analytics and Applications.

The notebooks are divided into different tasks and offer the following content:

1. Clustering.ipynb: In this notebook we want to find out which customer groups exist. For this purpose we use the K-Means clustering method.
2. Data_rocessing.ipynb: In this notebook the data will be cleaned.
3. Data_Visualization: In this notebook the data will be visualized to understand the data and find out which variables can then later be used for the prediction task.
4. Prediction.ipynb: In this notebook we build several models to predict the future demand based on different features of the dataset.
